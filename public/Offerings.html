      <h3>Pet care experience</h3>
      <p>I have fostered dogs, in my home for a rescue for the past 10 years. 
        Fostering requires me to get them ready to be adopted. Housebreaking, working on manners, and caring for older pets. 
        I have fostered almost every breed and even have experience with a blind dog. 
        I have also enjoyed being a pet sitter for cats as well.</p>
